<h2 class="pageHeader">Welcome!</h2>
  <p> This project makes improvements on a processor simulator called ZSIM to improve processor resource sharing and utilization, while also not inhibiting tasks from meeting time-sensitive deadlines. Every year, billions of dollars are invested into building data centers. However, these data centers currently over-provision resources to time-sensitive tasks in order to ensure that their deadlines are met. This results in wasted resources that could have been given to other tasks. As a result, our project aims to improve resource utilization while still having tasks meet their time-sensitive deadlines.
